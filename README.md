     - [Peter](https://github.com/pcarl006), Alan, [Brian](https://github.com/BFPC4)

#### Data Sets to be Used
- per capita income county data for US provided by instructors
- second to be determined by sub team 
    - potential source
        - World Inequality Database
        - The World Bank Data Catalog

#### 5 references (what's basis of inequality)

#### Questions and Uncertainties 
1. Web based visualization tool kits? Are we creating an actual package?
2. What is STARS? How does it relate to pysal?
3. Can we use jupyter notebooks to do something like STARS?
4. What visualization tool better serves our project (Jupyter Widgets, Dash, etc)?
5. How do we measure/define inequality?
6. What contributes to amounts of inequality within each state?
7. How do we make meaningful comparisons?
8. How can we use Quilt as the data source/layer for the project?
9. What regional/national systems should we focus on?
10. How many years of data do we need to use?
11. What criteria do we need to define specific areas of inequality? 
12. What new analytics/existing (from other packages) should be added to STARS?
13. Where do we find the new datasets to test?

#### Things we will focus on here

#### Plan/List of Tasks: 
- Data Component
    - research second data set, preferably one from the EU
    - import into jupyterhub
    - clean up data set, convert any string into number if necessary (finish by 05/05/2021 Sunday Night)
    - interface data with Quilt
    - design the data structure
- Analytic Component
    - work in pysal with existing analytic tools for inequality, ESDA, GIDDY, and linking all components
    - target
        - four stars views
        - others
- Visualization Component (start by 05/22/2021 Sunday Night)
    - view to view interactions
    - brushing/linking
    - view-generated-views
    - hover/mouse overs
    - decide on what toolkits to use, geopandas views or viola, panel, holoview, mpl
